# Progress: P.P EV Energy Co., Ltd. Website

## What Works
- Project initialization with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- Responsive navigation bar and footer components
- Home page with hero section, services, and customer showcases
- About page with company information, mission, and vision
- Customers page with client showcases and testimonials
- Contact page with form UI (backend integration pending)
- Tailwind CSS configuration with company brand colors
- Memory bank documentation established and maintained

## What's Left to Build
- Replace placeholder images with actual company assets
- Connect contact form to a backend service
- Implement SEO optimization with proper meta tags
- Add animations and transitions for enhanced UX
- Optimize performance (image compression, code splitting)
- Responsive design fine-tuning
- Browser compatibility testing
- Set up analytics tracking
- Configure deployment pipeline

## Current Status
Project has progressed from initial setup to implementation of all core functionality. The website now has a complete structure with all required pages implemented. The UI follows the company's brand guidelines with the specified color scheme (blue: #164A71, green: #93AE4F, grey: #C7C9C8).

The next immediate steps are to:
1. Replace placeholder content with actual company images and logos
2. Implement backend functionality for the contact form
3. Add SEO optimizations for better visibility
4. Prepare for deployment

## Known Issues
- Import errors for Navbar and Footer components in layout.tsx that need to be resolved
- Placeholder images need to be replaced with actual company assets
- Contact form lacks backend functionality
